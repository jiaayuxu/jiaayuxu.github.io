summary : Created a basic webpage

---
I created an email page based off of CSS and HTML for Dev-League application. Although I did not attend I did complete the assignment. This assignment was called Gee-mail, a simulated web application of an email inbox. I had to create the appearance of a mail box where random mail would show up every five seconds on a counter that is the inbox.
